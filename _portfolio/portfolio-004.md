This project involves a ROS-Gazebo simulation based on the research conducted with Dr. S. C. Nagavarapu. It focuses on unicycle-based graph exploration within an unknown structured environment. The robots operate in a decentralized manner without direct communication. Instead, they utilize static storage placed at vertices to store data. Any robot that reaches a previously explored vertex can access the data stored by earlier robots, ensuring continuity in the exploration process.
