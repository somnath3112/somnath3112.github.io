#### Pangolin 

Pangolin is a lightweight and efficient library for managing OpenGL display and interaction. It is particularly useful in SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) applications for visualizing the 3D environment and the trajectory of the robot in real-time. By providing an intuitive interface for rendering graphics, Pangolin helps developers to debug and analyze the performance of their SLAM algorithms effectively.
